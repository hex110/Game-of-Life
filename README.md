# Game-of-Life
Conway's Game of Life created in python, with different features added by me to learn how to use python better.

Used chatgpt 3.5 for a lot of help with the project, when I didn't know what command I had to use, I asked it, and it came up with every command I needed. The ideas of what to add and most ways of implementation are mine. Was able to quicken my workflow by a lot and I was able to add features really fast using chatgpt. Really useful assistant in creating stuff quickly. It also explains really well what everything does, so I was able to understand everything it added. Will certainly use it in the future as well.
